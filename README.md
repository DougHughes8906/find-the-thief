Command line based game. The player has lost his/her wallet at a party and needs to find who stole it before the party is over. When they player thinks they have the name of the thief, they can call the police. But the player needs to guess correctly the first time, otherwise the real theif will leave once the police arrive.

Each turn, the player can move to an adjacent space and a minute advances on the clock. The player should interact with other guests at the party, pick up clues, use objects in the room and use items to help determine the identity of the thief.

The game can be run in the command line by calling the "make" command and running the executable file ("./output" command).
